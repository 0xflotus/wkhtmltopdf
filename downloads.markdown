## Current Release (Stable)

The current stable version is [0.12.0](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/tag/0.12.0), which was released on Febuary 6, 2014.

### Windows

### Mac OS X

Mac OS X builds could not be produced due to issues in QT 4.8.5 &mdash; you will have to use the latest development snapshot instead.

## Latest Development Snapshots

A rolling development snapshot [0.12.1-dev](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wkhtmltopdf/files/0.12.1-dev/) of the master branch is available, which includes fixes since the 0.12.0 release.

We expect to release version 0.12.1 after QT 4.8.6 is released and after all critical bugs in the current release have been addressed.
